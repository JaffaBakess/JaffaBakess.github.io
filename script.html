	<p class="header">Introduction</p>
	<p class="script">Hello, is this ___?</p>
	<p class="script">Yeah, hello there. It's James calling from EuroSeal, Euro like the currency and Seal like the animal. How are we today?</p>
	<p class="script">It's just a quick one, just to let you know about the showroom we are opening at the end of the year, beginning of next for the exterior of property. Windows, doors, that type of thing.</p>
	<p class="script">Now, you know where you live? If you keep an eye out we're currently promoting a recycling scheme, where you could potentially get some money back for your older items on the property.</p>
	<p class="script"> Now to see if you're entitled. How old would you say your windows are on the property?</p>
	<p class="script">Would you say they're 5/10 or 15 years old?</p>
	<p class="script">And you are the home owner there aren't you?</p>
        <p class="header">Yes</p>
	<p class="script">That's brilliant, so that would mean that you are 100% entitled to the recycling scheme, as your windows on the property aren't energy efficient anymore, due to how they're manufactured.</p>
	<p class="script">Now I'm not gonna bore you with the technicalities as you and I both know you're not interested right now.</p>
	<p class="script">So let's say you were hypothetically ready for the end of the year, would you go for a white, black, brown, green or grey?</p>
	<p class="script">And when you got round to doing it, would it be the front for looks so it's nice and fancy, the back for security or would you do it all in one go if you got a banging price there?</p>
	<p class="script">Brilliant, so how many windows would that be?</p>
	<p class="script">And out of those how many of them are bay windows?</p>
	<p class="header">Consolidation</p>
	<p class="script">Okay, just so you're aware of what it is that we do when we come out to see you. We'll knock on, measure everything up from the outside, show you a couple samples, styles and designs and then leave you the price you're entitled to through this recycling scheme.</p>
	<p class="script">Now, all I'm going to ask of you is if the price and the products we leave with you are low and affordable enough. Just give us a call in the next 12 months, and if you don't like it in any way, throw it straight in the bin because this is a No-Obligation quote.</p>
	<p class="script">Is this fair enough?</p>
	<p class="header">Booking</p>
	<p class="script">Now, we are under a glass and glazing federation when we come out to see you. Do you have a partner that lives with you, as we have to see both homeowners?</p>
	<p class="script">And you are both the homeowners?</p>
	<p class="script">Okay, we are in the area all week from morning till late afternoon. What time would it be best to catch you both? Would it be in the morning, afternoon or late afternoon?</p>
	<p class="time">(Mon-Fri 10/1030, 12/1230, 14/1430, 16/1630, 18/1830)</p>
	<p class="time">(Sat 10/1030, 12/1230, 14/1430, 16/1630)</p>
	<p class="script">Brilliant, so please let your partner know about this scheme and that we are coming out to see you both. We don't want to knock on and scare them, as that's not a very good first impression, now is it.</p>
	<p class="script">So finally, the last and most crucial part of the phone call. My boss will give you a call shortly to let you know who's coming out to you and ask you three questions.</p>
	<p class="script">Firstly, he'll ask if it's okay we call on ___ at ___, so say that's fine.</p>
	<p class="script">Then he'll ask what we are leaving the price on, so just let him know it's the ___.</p>
	<p class="script">Finally, he will say I know you aren't interested right now, and you are under no obligation. However, if you did get the right price, do you know when you might start? Just let him know it'll be within the next 12 months if you get the right price. Is that okay?</p>
	<p class="script">Fantastic, now be honest with me. You don't mind us coming out and leaving you this piece of paper with the price on it, right</p>
	<p class="script">And this is the best way to contact you, or would it be your landline?</p>
	<p class="script">You can answer your phone when my boss calls on an 07 number or an 01782 number from our home office. If you don't recognise the number, give it a quick call back it'll be my boss.</p>
	<p class="script">Excellent, well in regards to this call. I'm going to love you and leave you with my discount code. Do you have a pen and paper to hand? My code is <u><strong>EU007</strong></u>. Did you get that down?</p>
	<p class="script">Brilliant, in that case, we will see you on ___ at ___. Thank you for your time. Goodbye.</p>
